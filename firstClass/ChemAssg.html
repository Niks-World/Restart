    <section>
        
        <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition, and behavior of matter. It is a fascinating field that explores the building blocks of the universe.</p>

        <h2> Chemistry Elements </h2>
        <p>The <mark>periodic table</mark> is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties.</p>

        <h2>Chemical Equations</h2>
        <p>Chemical reactions are represented using chemical equations. Here's an example of a chemical reaction:</p>
        <p>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> â†’ 2H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
        <p>This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>) and oxygen gas (O<sub>2</sub>) to form water (H<sub>2</sub>O).</p>

        <h2>Important Concepts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stoichiometry:</strong> The calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.</li>
            <li>Subscripts indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while superscripts represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion.</li>
       
        </ul>
