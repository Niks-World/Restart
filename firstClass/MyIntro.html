        <p> My name is Nikki. I am from Bodh Gaya, Bihar. 
            I have completed my Bachelor's degree in Political Science from Madrid University.
             Although my interest lies in computer science and technology,
              I decided to give myself another chance. 
              I found a massage school offering a 30-week web development course.
               I enrolled myself in it and will dedicate myself to completing it.
                Additionally, I will spend less time on distractions, such as social media, and 
                focus on practicing coding and solving over 700+ DSA Question. So, 
                this is all about me. 
                Thank you so much.</p>
